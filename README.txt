js.readmore
***********

Introduction
============

This library packages `CReadmore`_ for `fanstatic`_.

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`readmore`: http://jedfoster.com/Readmore.js/

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js.readmore``) are published to some URL.
